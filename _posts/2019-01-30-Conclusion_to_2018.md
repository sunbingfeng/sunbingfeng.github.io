## Medium

### Highlight

- From [Make Peace With One Thing to Get More Out of Life](https://medium.com/personal-growth/make-peace-with-one-thing-to-get-more-out-of-life-dac0fdd5b9a2):

	>Everybody wants to matter. To make a difference. To stand out, be noticed, and admired (maybe even envied) by others.

	Just do myself and ignore what others think of me.
	
- From [How to stay motivated when learning to code (10 actionable tips!)](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-stay-motivated-when-learning-to-code-10-actionable-tips-f5f208f917db)

	> Build up your willpower muscle.
	
	You are more powerful than you ever imagined.
- From [Achieving impossible coding tasks without knowing how to do them](https://blog.sourcerer.io/achieving-impossible-coding-tasks-without-knowing-how-to-do-them-50eea39ef43)

	> You’ve painted yourself into a corner, and the only way out is to do the thing you’ve been putting off
    
	Do not hesitate to go on and be brave!
	
- From [What Business Leaders Can Learn from Honeybees](https://medium.com/s/story/to-make-your-business-more-efficient-take-a-lesson-from-bee-colonies-7c5ffd0ba4c5)

	> Don’t confuse the queen bee as being the most important part of a colony; it is the role she serves that is most important
		
	Invest your time and resources on what deserves the most.
	
	Think of your workmates as just bees with different roles, and then you may find it easier to deal and cooperate with them. Thus you can survive in annoying office politics.

## Achievement

- Passed the postgraduate admission test
- Won PMP certificate.[See, I'm qualified.](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/f18e196e-5591-491e-8d0d-87b10ea608ff/linked_in_profile)

## Me && Me

- Almost 8 years passed since I last did algorithm research, and I'm doing it again. This time, it's about vehicle localization using computer vision technology. I can read English papers fluently now, and with more patience.
- I started to write blogs. Not excellent yet, but it's a good start. And I'm not expecting to be famous someday. Recording experience earned gives me a sense of fulfillment.
- Last year, I thought many about how to be a good tech leader, and how to collaborate with others. I think I'm an excellent software programmer in the eyes of others, but maybe not a good teammate. I wish I could behave better in year 2019.
