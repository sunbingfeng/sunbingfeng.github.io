## Words To You

*Act as if what you do makes a difference. It does.
---William James*

## Soft Skills
[1] [unix playstation](https://www.unixgame.io/unix50?zoom=100): To master unix command through interactive games, and it's interesting.

[2] [stackoverflow for teams](https://stackoverflow.com/teams?utm_source=Iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=the-overflow-newsletter&utm_content=10-16-19): I think it's really good to recommend to each technical team. It helps you to find the right answer accurately and quickly.

## Technical Posts

[1] [Multi-thread analysis](https://easyperf.net/blog/2019/10/05/Performance-Analysis-Of-MT-apps): Three metrics to evaluate your multi-thread app are: 1, performance scaling; 2, CPU utilization; 3, synchronization overhead.

[2] [pub-sub VS. observable pattern](https://medium.com/easyread/difference-between-pub-sub-pattern-and-observable-pattern-d5ae3d81e6ce): The main difference between these two is that, in pub-sub pattern, the publisher and subcriber will never know about the existence of one another.

## Useful Tools
[1] [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome): A collection of tools and e-books, categorized according to different techinal stack, or languages, and it's still under continous update.

[2] [vimium](https://vimium.github.io/): It's a Chrome extension which provides keyboard shortcuts for navigating and control in the spirit of Vim editor, and it's really cool. Highly recommended!

[3] [nbobservable](https://github.com/sunbingfengPI/nbobservable): A light-weight implemention of observable pattern in cpp.

[4] [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine): A command-line benchmarking tool. Thanks to this tool, I begin to realize that 'fd' runs nearly 10x faster than default 'find' command.
