## About Me

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/bill_coffee.JPG" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

I'm a robotics software engineer currently working on sensor fusion and vision-based localization. My daily work involves using RADAR, SONAR, Camera, IMU and other sensors for autonomous applications, including indoor vaccum cleaner and low-speed logistics vehicle.

Prior to this, I used to work on embedded software developing and iOS app developing. Top three coding language I ever used and master well are C++, C, and Objective-C.

Technical communications are welcomed, and also are job hunters.

I love coding, and that's all.
