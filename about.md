I am a robotics software engineer specializing in sensor fusion and vision-based localization. In my current role, I work extensively with multi-sensor systems, integrating RADAR, SONAR, cameras, and IMU data to develop robust autonomous solutions. My expertise spans across various applications, from indoor vacuum cleaners to low-speed logistics vehicles, where precise sensor fusion is crucial for reliable autonomous navigation.

My journey in software development began with embedded systems and iOS application development. Over the years, I've mastered several programming languages, with C++, C, and Objective-C being my primary tools of choice. This diverse technical background allows me to approach robotics challenges from multiple perspectives, combining low-level system understanding with high-level application development.

I'm passionate about technology and always eager to engage in technical discussions. Whether you're interested in robotics, sensor fusion, or software development, I welcome opportunities to connect and share knowledge. I'm also open to discussing potential career opportunities that align with my expertise.

At the core, I'm a developer who loves coding and solving complex technical challenges. This passion drives me to continuously learn and improve in the ever-evolving field of robotics and autonomous systems.
